 To find out what changes were made between version 16 and 17 of the `odoo` repository, we can use the `GitPython` library to query the Git repository. Here's an example of how to do this:
```
from git import Repository
def get_modified_files_between_versions(version1, version2):
    # Initialize the Git repository
    repo = Repository('.')
    # Get the commit objects for the two versions
    commit1 = repo.log(version1).commit
    commit2 = repo.log(version2).commit
    # Get the diff between the two commits
    diff = commit2.diff(commit1)
    # Iterate over the modified files and print their paths
    for file in diff.diff_files:
        print(file.path)

# Example usage:
get_modified_files_between_versions('16', '17')
```
This code will print the paths of all the files that were modified between version 16 and 17 of the `odoo` repository.
